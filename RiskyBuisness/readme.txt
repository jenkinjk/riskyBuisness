Instructions

To play risk:

Select the number of players from the drop down box. 
The game will then randomly assign each player a fair share of the board,
and in each of the newly owned territories deploy 3 armies.

It is now player one's turn. It starts with the deployment phase. Click on
you armies to deploy extra troops to them. Plan carefully here! You must
outnumber your opponent by at least one to attack, and defenders have a
serious advantage over attackers!
When you have place all your reinfocements clike the next phase button.

It is now the combat phase. You can click first on one of your armies,
then on a neighboring enemy army to launch a battle! Note that if you mis
click you can simply start over with your clicking process (so your own army,
then your opponents) and the battle logic will sort it out. Fight as many 
battles as you wish.
Note that if the attacker wins, he must send troops to occupy the territory
and leave some behind as well. This is handled in a pop after the battle.
Once you have battled as much as you wish click the next phase button.

You now have the option to reinforce. This means you click on one of your 
armies, then a second one of your armies. You then select a number of armies
to send from the first selected territory to the second. This is useful for 
moving armies to the front from areas that are well protected.

Remember, if you own an entire continent you get bonus armies.

You also get bonus armies for turning in cards. Turn in 3 of a kind or
1 of each type to recieve bonus armies. Each time you turn in cards,
the bonus for turning in gets bigger!
